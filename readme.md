# Hogwarts Diploma Creator âš¡ðŸª„

This simple script creates a Hogwarts Academy Diploma for the user. The diploma has the attributes of the user's preferences such as; student name, house name etc.

It creates the file from a **word document** template and also converts into a **pdf** file.

The requirements for this script to work are:

* pandas
* docxtpl
* docx2pdf
* docx
* Harryp font (to use harryp font in the files but it is contained in the assets folder)

For now, it can be only used in terminal to input user preferences but repo will improve in time.

## Future Improvements

* Fully dynamic functions
  * Updating the **path** for each user
  * Dynamic args for more responsive functions
* GUI implementation for the end-user
  * Simplistic window for the user to easily navigate
  * Path finding widget for the user to add a **csv file** easily
* Optimizing PDF conversion as it is a slow process.
* Possible new features to add.
